          When building a website, HTML code gives a result too bland. There are
          ways to style it using inline code, but this is too annoying. This is
          where Cascading Style Sheet CSS comes to play.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS is quite easy to use once you understand how everything is
          connected and is the gateway to many career paths especially UI and UX
          desginers.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide will assume that you have prior knowledge of the
          following:<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic computer literacy</li>
          <li>Basic knowledge of working with files</li>
          <li>HTML basics</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="semantics" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Semantics</h2></header>
        <p>
          The semantics of CSS are an analogy of those of HTML. Like HTML has
          tags and elements inside them, CSS has selectors and properties inside
          them. The difference is that the properties affect the selectors
          unlike the elements.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, what you write in HTML is defined in selectors, and in CSS,
          when you write the respective selectors, whatever properties you use
          change the element in HTML.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following, I have a "p" element written in HTML. On the right,
          I used CSS to apply the background-color property to make the
          background red and the border property to add black, solid borders.
        </p>
        <div class="codex">
          <pre>
                <code id="html"> < p > 
                    Here is a paragraph element that will 
                    have a red background and black borders
                < / p >
                </code>
            </pre>
          <pre>
            <code id="css">p {
                background-color: red;
                border: black solid;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          An important note is that in CSS, the characteristics of the element
          will not be necessarily taken according to the order written. In
          properties, CSS rules state that the second property will be taken. In
          values, they will be taken in the order written and will only skip if
          the value are unavailable.
        </p>
        <div class="codex">
          <div>
            <pre>
                <code id="html"> p {
                font-family: calibri;
                font-family: sans-serif;      
                }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Sans-serif will be used.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <pre>
                <code id="css">p {
                font-family: calibri , sans-serif;
                }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Calibri will be used unless it is unavailable.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          In HTML, one can specialize an element over another using a class or
          id. Well in CSS, these come in pretty handy since you can choose to
          style only this set of elements and not all that have the same tags.
        </p>
        <div class="codex">
          <pre>
            <code id="html"> .example {
              /*anything mentioned here will only apply to the elements with class "example"*/
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
          <pre>
                  <code id="html"> #example {
                    /*anything mentioned here will only apply to the element with id "example"*/
                  }
                  </code>
              </pre>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note: In CSS, anything between
            <code class="inlinecode">/* ------ */</code> will be commented out
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="styling" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Styling</h2></header>
        <p>When it comes to styling there are many elements to cover:<br /></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text</li>
          <li>Image</li>
          <li>Body</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and many others. So here we will only talk about text and images.</p>
        <p>
          Just like in Microsoft Word, you can change the text however you wish.
          In the following, we change the color, size, weight, and family of the
          font of the p element only.
        </p>
        <div class="codex">
          <pre><code>p {
            color: red;
            font-size: 10px;
            font-weight: bolder;
            font-family: calibri , sans-serif;
            }
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          Images can be styled in anyway you can imagine. Whether is it were to
          resize, add a border, add border-radius, change opacity, or add a
          filter, all of these can be done.<br />
          An important note is that in border, the order taken will be in the
          clockwise direction tsarting from top (top, right, bottom, left).
        </p>
        <div class="codex">
          <pre><code>img {
              width: 100px;
              height: 150px;
              border: red dotted 3px;
              border-radius: 5px;
              opacity: 0.7;
              filter: grayscale(60%);
            }
              </code></pre>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="display" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Display</h2></header>
        <div id="boxmodel">
          <p>
            In display, always refer to the box model. The box model is a visual
            representaion that shows how all elements are wrapped in a box
            surrounded by padding, border, and margins.
          </p>
          <img id="model" src="img1.png" />
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Padding: clears an area directly around the content within the box.
            It is usually transparent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Border: goes around the padding and shows the boundaries of the
            division.
          </li>
          <li>Margin: clears an area around the division. It is transparent</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          When choosing the display property, keep in mind you are choosing how
          will the children of this element appear.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Grid: You can divide the division into a grid and fill the cells
            with the children
          </li>
          <li>
            Flex: You can have more freedom and control the children's position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Block: The division will appear as a block on a new line and all
            children will be positioned in this block.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Position is simply related to where and how will you see the division.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed: This will fix the division to a single place (best used with
            navbars).
          </li>
          <li>
            Relative: Using this with some more properties allows you to
            position the division relatively to where it will normally appear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Absolute: The division will be positioned relatively to its first
            positioned ancestor.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="animations" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Animations</h2></header>
        <p>
          When you hover over a button, sometimes the colors change, sometimes
          it darkens, and sometimes it changes place. These effects don't need
          the advanced works of JavaScript. They are all made possible by the
          toolkit of animations properties of CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing you need to do is add when you want the animation to
          play. The following code specifies that when the user hovers over the
          button, the opacity must become 0.6.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>btn:hover {
        opacity: 0.6;      
        }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          But this will create a choppy effect. The solution is to add a
          transition to the original element.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>btn {
          transition: 0.3s ease-out;      
          }</code>
          </pre>
        <p>
          In addition, CSS offers an array of transform codes that can be used
        </p>
        <div class="codex">
          <code>translate(...)</code>
          <code>scale(...)</code>
          <code>rotate(...)</code>
        </div>
        <p>
          To have more control over what happens when, we can use the keyframes
          command where we can specify what should the conditions be at certain
          intervals of time. Then whatever animation we created can be linked
          back to element.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>btn:hover {
                animation-name: zoom;
                animation-time: 1s;
            }

            @keyframes zoom {
                0%{
                    scale(1);
                }
                100%{
                    scale(2);
                }
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
